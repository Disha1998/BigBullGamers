# BigBullGamers ðŸ¤– : "Platform for the next generation Games and Gamers" - Gamvertisment, RentNFT Assets and Interact with Gamers in Metaverse. ðŸŒŽ



## Why?



In Blockchain Gaming, not being able to afford NFTs is becoming a â€œBig Barrier to Entry" for many
players.



With the adoption of the metaverse, the demand for virtual land NFTs are rising but there are no ways
for **long-term holders** to be able to generate the **value of** their **virtual lands.**



There are many games, generalized jobs platforms, and different gaming communities but no platform
where **Game Players, Builders, Animation artists, Metaverse Virtual estate agents** can interact and
network with like minded individuals.



## What?



**BigBullGamers.** is a platform for next generation Gamers and Games where players, builders,
animators, and investors can connect with each other, generate passive income by renting
their in game assets, or by allowing Gamevertisement (Game Advertisement) on their virtual
land NFTs.



## How it works:



**Connect @ Metaverse:** At BigBullGamers, users will be able to visit virtual contests and can have text
and audio chat with virtual visitors of the metaverse across the globe.



**NFT Asset Rental:** A zero collateral rental platform to lend and Borrow Game NFT Assets. Another
option is collateral lending but because of huge price and volatility, Collateralized lending is not a
practical way rent NFTs. Eg: Not every individual can collateralize 150 Eth to use Cryptopunk.



**Gamervertisement: Gamvertisement is -> Advertisement** in Gaming. Here NFT owners can generate
passive income by allowing billboards like in game ads in blockchain games.
